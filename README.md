Co developed a Solar-powered water level detecting systems in a team of 4. 
I was responsible for the development of water probe by investigating the effects of different dielectric material (silicone rubber and PVC) on the accuracy of the design in detecting changes in capacitance due to the changes in water level
I then designed the geometry of the probe and ran a feasibility test to find the design with the highest benefot-to-cost ratio
I ran an FEMM simulations to prove that my design is working as expected
I helped with the design of the transmitter circuit and iteratively found the correct probe's capacitance that was matching our intended accuracy levels when the water is low
